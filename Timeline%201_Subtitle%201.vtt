01:00:01.333 --> 01:00:03.791
Hello everybody and if you're here thank

2
01:00:03.791 --> 01:00:08.916
you so much. We have a long way to go and

3
01:00:09.375 --> 01:00:12.125
hopefully this is the beginning of an

4
01:00:12.125 --> 01:00:16.291
amazing adventure. Today we're gonna

5
01:00:16.291 --> 01:00:20.958
tackle the CRM system, what is CRM and

6
01:00:20.958 --> 01:00:23.916
ultimately how we're gonna utilize it

7
01:00:23.916 --> 01:00:27.500
for our benefit. Customer relationship

8
01:00:27.500 --> 01:00:31.125
management is the way that we catalog

9
01:00:31.208 --> 01:00:35.500
every interaction from our ads and our

10
01:00:35.500 --> 01:00:38.041
posts and basically the people that

11
01:00:38.041 --> 01:00:42.875
interact with us. The first step is to

12
01:00:42.875 --> 01:00:46.000
download Notion or open your account in

13
01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:49.166
Notion, you can open in your browser. I

14
01:00:49.166 --> 01:00:52.041
have it on both my desktop and my

15
01:00:52.875 --> 01:00:58.291
browser and once you have an account with

16
01:00:58.291 --> 01:01:01.583
Notion it's gonna look like this.

17
01:01:02.250 --> 01:01:05.875
Welcome to Notion, simple stuff. If you

18
01:01:05.875 --> 01:01:07.583
don't know what Notion is just

19
01:01:07.583 --> 01:01:11.500
think about it as like an excel sheet on

20
01:01:11.500 --> 01:01:13.416
steroids. No, you can add different

21
01:01:13.583 --> 01:01:19.416
things to your tables that in an excel

22
01:01:19.416 --> 01:01:23.500
sheet look kind of dull and uninspiring.

23
01:01:23.791 --> 01:01:27.375
Notion is a good tool to put ideas into

24
01:01:27.375 --> 01:01:32.375
place. So you're gonna click on the link

25
01:01:32.375 --> 01:01:37.000
that you have on your portal and it looks

26
01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:39.500
like this. It's the duplicate for

27
01:01:39.500 --> 01:01:41.208
clients, you are my client and this is a

28
01:01:41.208 --> 01:01:43.708
duplicate for you. What you're gonna do

29
01:01:43.708 --> 01:01:48.000
now and now that you have your Notion

30
01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:51.916
account open, you're gonna click on the

31
01:01:51.916 --> 01:01:53.666
menu over here and you're gonna say

32
01:01:53.666 --> 01:01:57.041
duplicate to your workspace. It's gonna

33
01:01:57.041 --> 01:02:00.666
look like your name, your workspace, it

34
01:02:00.666 --> 01:02:03.000
takes a second and now it creates a

35
01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:12.500
duplicate inside your Notion files. This

36
01:02:12.500 --> 01:02:13.541
is where the magic

37
01:02:13.541 --> 01:02:15.750
happens, right? So let's

38
01:02:15.750 --> 01:02:18.833
go to my Instagram. Your ad is going to

39
01:02:18.833 --> 01:02:22.750
generate a bunch of likes, a bunch of

40
01:02:22.916 --> 01:02:25.875
comments, a bunch of follows. I'm gonna

41
01:02:25.875 --> 01:02:27.708
show you how we deal with a

42
01:02:27.750 --> 01:02:33.083
follow, how we deal with a like or any

43
01:02:33.083 --> 01:02:35.458
interaction. So let's see, people

44
01:02:35.500 --> 01:02:39.333
follow me from my ads. So I go to their

45
01:02:39.333 --> 01:02:43.041
profile and obviously businesses interact

46
01:02:43.041 --> 01:02:46.125
with me, right? Regular people will

47
01:02:46.125 --> 01:02:48.375
interact with you but it is important to

48
01:02:48.500 --> 01:02:53.708
see who they are, what they do and

49
01:02:53.708 --> 01:02:58.958
ultimately give them a little something

50
01:02:59.916 --> 01:03:03.791
to respond to. So you're gonna say...

51
01:03:20.958 --> 01:03:23.583
This message is "Hello, thank you for the

52
01:03:23.583 --> 01:03:25.375
follow, how is the store going?" Because

53
01:03:25.375 --> 01:03:28.500
obviously this is pertinent to what I do

54
01:03:28.500 --> 01:03:32.875
as a business but you can do, if you run

55
01:03:32.875 --> 01:03:35.833
a hair salon, you can say "Oh, like I can

56
01:03:35.833 --> 01:03:36.708
see your hair looks

57
01:03:36.708 --> 01:03:38.125
good, when do you do?"

58
01:03:38.125 --> 01:03:40.666
Like, you know, I don't run a hair salon,

59
01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:43.708
right? But there are

60
01:03:43.708 --> 01:03:45.458
questions that you can, there are

61
01:03:45.500 --> 01:03:47.458
interactions you can have with your

62
01:03:47.458 --> 01:03:51.250
customers that are not robotic, we're

63
01:03:51.250 --> 01:03:54.000
not trying to make a sale, we are trying

64
01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:58.041
to create a relationship and it is a

65
01:03:58.041 --> 01:04:01.416
relationship that will last a long time.

66
01:04:01.416 --> 01:04:04.250
It's a relationship where a customer

67
01:04:04.833 --> 01:04:08.791
becomes a fan, it becomes an advocate for

68
01:04:08.791 --> 01:04:11.166
your brand, right? So...

69
01:04:19.333 --> 01:04:21.833
We send a message and now you're gonna

70
01:04:21.833 --> 01:04:26.125
copy the... Now you're

71
01:04:26.125 --> 01:04:28.541
gonna copy the Instagram

72
01:04:28.583 --> 01:04:33.583
link of the conversation, you are going

73
01:04:33.583 --> 01:04:37.125
to go to your CRM and you're going to say

74
01:04:37.166 --> 01:04:44.625
first, the username is BestBuds, the

75
01:04:44.625 --> 01:04:47.500
message link is copied,

76
01:04:48.416 --> 01:04:50.166
the status here, I'm gonna

77
01:04:50.208 --> 01:04:52.583
say it's a new lead, we're gonna change

78
01:04:52.583 --> 01:04:53.833
the labels on these

79
01:04:53.833 --> 01:04:58.333
according to your industry

80
01:04:58.375 --> 01:05:03.000
and we're going to say "remind me a week

81
01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:05.041
from now", that's all

82
01:05:05.041 --> 01:05:06.875
you have to do. So now

83
01:05:06.916 --> 01:05:11.625
over here in the lower section of my

84
01:05:11.625 --> 01:05:15.416
Notion file, you have now

85
01:05:15.416 --> 01:05:18.708
BestBuds, which is my new

86
01:05:18.708 --> 01:05:23.875
follower, right? And in, let's say that I

87
01:05:23.875 --> 01:05:26.875
had the date for today,

88
01:05:27.375 --> 01:05:30.333
it will appear here. So it

89
01:05:30.375 --> 01:05:33.833
automatically will remind you when to...

90
01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:37.708
If you click on the

91
01:05:37.708 --> 01:05:39.333
conversation link, it will take you

92
01:05:39.333 --> 01:05:43.708
to the conversation. So now you have a

93
01:05:43.708 --> 01:05:46.250
reminder and a link to go

94
01:05:46.250 --> 01:05:48.500
back to every time you need to

95
01:05:48.541 --> 01:05:55.541
talk to your customer. And you can make

96
01:05:55.541 --> 01:05:58.583
notes on your CRM system. Now you can

97
01:05:58.583 --> 01:06:09.333
They run ACVD store, no response yet.

98
01:06:10.625 --> 01:06:18.708
We'll check next week. And the important

99
01:06:18.708 --> 01:06:20.208
part is to space them

100
01:06:20.250 --> 01:06:23.958
out in a way that feels natural, that

101
01:06:23.958 --> 01:06:28.750
it's not too pushy, where you can send

102
01:06:28.750 --> 01:06:29.916
coupons from time to

103
01:06:29.916 --> 01:06:34.291
time. This is a major thing. Every like,

104
01:06:34.541 --> 01:06:36.916
every comment, we catalog it in the CRM

105
01:06:36.916 --> 01:06:38.833
system. And that way,

106
01:06:39.500 --> 01:06:42.416
we are always on top of the people that

107
01:06:42.416 --> 01:06:46.416
are interested in our brand that...

108
01:06:51.791 --> 01:06:54.958
So in short, this is a very easy way to

109
01:06:54.958 --> 01:06:57.916
stay on top of customers, potential

110
01:06:57.916 --> 01:07:01.791
clients, leads. This is

111
01:07:01.916 --> 01:07:04.416
where the magic happens because this is

112
01:07:04.416 --> 01:07:06.000
happens. A customer requires

113
01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:06.583
where the magic happens because this is

114
01:07:06.583 --> 01:07:06.875
really where the magic

115
01:07:06.875 --> 01:07:10.666
a certain amount of repeated interactions

116
01:07:10.666 --> 01:07:12.791
with your content for them

117
01:07:12.791 --> 01:07:16.250
to purchase. So it's important

118
01:07:16.458 --> 01:07:22.791
to stay on top of who is interested and

119
01:07:22.791 --> 01:07:24.500
who can benefit from your

120
01:07:24.500 --> 01:07:27.541
product. Like, we're all human.

121
01:07:27.916 --> 01:07:30.083
We all need things and we are all

122
01:07:30.083 --> 01:07:32.666
providing products and

123
01:07:32.666 --> 01:07:33.875
services that are important.

124
01:07:34.666 --> 01:07:38.166
So let's get out there and let's make

125
01:07:38.166 --> 01:07:39.083
more relationships.

126
01:07:39.625 --> 01:07:41.916
Let's make more people happy

127
01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:43.291
with the things that

128
01:07:43.291 --> 01:07:46.000
we create. Thank you.
